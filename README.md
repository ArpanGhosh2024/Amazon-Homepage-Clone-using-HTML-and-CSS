# Amazon-Homepage-Clone-using-HTML-and-CSS
In this project, I have developed the clone of Amazon's home page from scratch using HTML and CSS. In this project, I tried to re-create just the design and the look and feel of Amazon's homepage and not the actual functionality of the website. I have used Font Awesome to include the necessary icons/logos in my project (https://fontawesome.com/).
